#Currency Converter with Flag Display
##Overview
This project is a simple Currency Converter application built using Python's tkinter library for the GUI and the Pillow library for image processing. The application allows users to select a base currency and a target currency from a dropdown menu, input an amount, and then convert the amount using real-time exchange rates retrieved from an external API. The corresponding flags of the selected currencies are also displayed next to the dropdown menus.
